# Pipe Buoy: 3D Parts

This repository contains all the 3D parts for the Pipe Buoy project.  
Always make sure to pull the latest before starting a new build.  

## Generic Module
This part is the most generic part of the project.   
It is used to connect the different modules together.  
Its platform runs perpindicular to the pipes endcaps.  
In the hackaday project, this part is used to hold both the batteries.  
Another instance of the part is used to hold the Rapberry Pi, SSD, and USB Cell Modem.

## Raspberry Pi Mounting Adapter
Because the Raspberry Pi's mounting holes are not in the same place as the generic module,
we use this part to mount the Raspberry Pi to the generic bolt pattern found on the module.

## Cell Antenna Module
This module is used to hold the cell antenna. Its platform runs parallel to the pipes endcaps.

## SSD And Modem Strap
This part is used to hold the SSD and USB Cell Modem to the generic module.

## Shorty Strap
This part is used to hold 2S "shorty" batteries to the generic module.

## Reef Camera Internal Mount
Not used for the internals of the pipe buoy, but rather for the reef camera.
This part is used to correctly orient the USB Camera inside of the GoPro housing.
